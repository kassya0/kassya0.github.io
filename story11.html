<p>Man: Oh, well alright. Then take a sit on my porch while I'll be right back</p>
<p> The man hesitiently goes insde, leaving the door not fully closed but that you can see can see a crack 
<br>
<br>
<p> (I sit on the man's porch.)

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>He's kind of taking a while..<p>
<br>
<p>Should I make a <a href="story16.html">run</a> for it?
