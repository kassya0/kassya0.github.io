<img src="happy.jpg" alt="alternatetext" width="500" height="600">
<p>You have successfully finished the game. The girl, Iris, went into questioning with the police and have arrested the "mother". The mother is sentenced for the death pentaly. </p>
<br>
<p> Iris had been an orphan, just for a short while, until the ranger decided to adopt her. 
<br>
<p> Iris has been trying to live a normal life ever since. It hasn’t been easy—memories slip in and out, and doubts linger—but with her adopted father by her side, she’s managed to hold on. Every day has been a struggle, but slowly, things have started to feel... more like they could be okay. He’s been her rock, her support, always there with a steady hand when she needed it most. She doesn’t remember the life she once had, but maybe it doesn’t matter. She’s building a new life, piece by piece, even if it feels fragile at times.
