<p>*I'll be here a while, might as well talk with him*</p>
<br>
<p> Yeah, it's just my mom and me. I don’t remember my dad being in the picture.

<p> Man: Oh yea? You don't have any memory of him..?
<br>
<p> Uh, no. Not that I can think of at this moment.
<br>
<p> Man: (Pauses)I see..
<br>
<p> Yea...
<br>
<p> Man: Do you live around here? It seems like you know the area pretty well.
<br>
<p> No, but I keep finding myself back in this neighborhood. Not sure why, though…
<br>
<p> Man: Oh yea? Any family here? Friends?
<br>
<p> Uh… no. No family. No friends either… I just like the area. It feels familiar to me, even though I’ve never lived around here. Kinda silly, isn’t it? ( I chuckle nervously.)
<br>
<p> Man: Of course not, Some places just… call to people.
<br>
<p>(The man studies me for a moment, his expression unreadable.)
<br>
<pr>Man: So, you really don’t remember your dad? Not even a little?
<br>
<p>(Frowning slightly.) No… why?
<br>
<p> (The man smiles a bit) Hah, just a silly question. 
<br>
<p> oh..ok.. <a href="story20.html">...</a>
