<p>Uh no, I'm not lost. I can find my way out of here. I've been here before</p>
<br>
<p> oh.. ok then well carry on then.
<br>
<p> (The man takes one at me, then hesistantly carries on his way)
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<p> Why did I lie? I've only been here when I was younger, and I have no instinct or memory of where I'm going.
<br>
<p> Should I go back and say the <a href="story26.html"> truth?
<br>
<p> or <a href="story28.html"> continue down this path?
