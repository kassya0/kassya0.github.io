<p> Actually, yea I am pretty lost. Do you have a phone I can borrow to call my mom? </p>
<br>
<p> Man: I do. Come, follow me.
<br>
<p> ok
<br>
<p> *walk walk walk walk walk*
<br>
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<p> Man: So, have you been to this path before?
<br>
<p> Yea, only when I was little though. Haven't been here since. 
<br>
<p> Man: oh yea? why is that?
<br>
<p> Eh, my mom doesn't let me
<br>
<p> Man: ...I see. If your mom often strict with you?
<br>
<p> Sometimes, but it's tough love. She protective of me.
<br>
<p> Man: But a young lady like you, looks like you're old enough to make your own decisons
<br>
<p> yea, tell that to her.
<br>
<p>Man: *chuckles* Yeah, moms can be like that. She just wants what’s best for you, I suppose.
<br>
<p>*shrugs* I guess. It’s just—she worries too much. Like, I get it, the world’s not sunshine and rainbows, but she acts like I’ll fall apart the second I step outside.
<br>
<p>Man: That sounds exhausting.
<br>
<p>*nods* It is. I can’t even go out without her calling me a hundred times. I'm lucky I don't have my phone with me right now or else she will be blowing it up right now
<br>
<p>Man: Maybe she’s had a reason to be this way.
<br>
<p> …Maybe. But she never tells me anything. Just "I know what’s best for you."
<br>
<p>Man: *softly* Parents have their secrets too.
<br>
<p> *frowns* …What’s that supposed to mean?
