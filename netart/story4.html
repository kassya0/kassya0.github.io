<p>hey,, this is actually nice. It's quiet, no distractions whatsoever. Hope no one else is here with me haha..ah I shouldn't jinx say it.<p> 
<p>Look at those trees. Beautiful, let me take a pictu- oh right my phone is dead. Hmm.

<p>God how long is this walk for. I should have been at the other side by now. Should I just run the rest there?<p>
<br>
<p>nah
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> ...
<p> it' been a while since I walked here by myself. <p>
<p>I remember walking along this path when I was younger.. but my mom stopped me for some reason..weird.I should ask her why.I missed walking here. <p>
<br>
<p> She can be a bit overprotective at times, but I'm older now. Old enough to make my own desicions. 
<br>
<p> She's going to kill me when she finds out where I've been. I'm not even suppose to be out. I'm never allowed out anymore.
