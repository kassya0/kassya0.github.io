<p>Man: *shrugs* Just saying… sometimes when people are overprotective, it’s because they’re hiding something. Maybe something they don’t want you to know.
<br>
<p>*laughs dryly* Yeah, right. Like what? Some deep secret?
<br>
<p>Man:smirks You never know. Maybe she’s keeping you safe from something… or someone.
<br>
<p> *shifting uncomfortably* That’s ridiculous. She’s just being a mom.
<br>
<p>Man:*nods slowly* Sure. But tell me this...has she ever told you exactly why she doesn’t let you go out?
<br>
<p>*frown* *thinking* I mean… she says it’s dangerous. That bad things can happen.
<br>
<p>Man: And do you believe her?
<br>
<p> *scoffs* I don’t know. I used to think she was just paranoid, but… hesitates I guess sometimes, it feels like she’s scared of something specific.</p>
<br>
<p>Man: Maybe she is...
<br>
<p>Man: *laughs lightly* Ah, but what do I know? Moms will be moms. No point in overthinking it.
<br>
<p>*relaxes a little* Yeah… I guess.
<br>
<p>Man: Anyway, I have my car around here, let me make a quick phonecall before you can call your mom. Stay put alright kiddo.
