<h1>???</h1>
<p>Yea that's where you're wrong bud- that's not my name, my name is emily</p>
<br>
<p> Man: But it is. Iris. You've have been missing for over 10 years..
<br>
<p>..What?</p>
<br>
<p> Man:I know this is hard to hear. And believe me, it’ll take time for it to sink in, but just hear me out, okay? 
<br>
<p>...</p>
<br>
<p> Man: You were kidnapped by a random woman who took you from a firehouse... a fire where your real family tragically died. She recently lost her own child, a little girl around your age, about four years old. Everyone thought you died in that fire, but there was evidence that suggested otherwise..People have been looking for your for years. But she changed her appearance. She dyed your hair blonde didn't she?
<br>
<p>......</p>
<br>
<p> Man:She went into hiding. After seeing all the missing posters around the city, she knew she had to change. She hid you and herself so well, no one could find you for years.. 
<br>
<p>*Take a folded missing paper from his pocket and puts it close to her face*  
<br>
<p> Man:Ha, exact match. But I knew I couldn't rely off appearance alone.. so that's why I needed to see your hand. Again, I'm sorry for scaring you like that
<br>
<p> (The man has a regretful expression)
<br>
<p> Man:Again, I’m sorry for scaring you like that. But I had to be sure.
