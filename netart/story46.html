<br>
<p> I'm not going to hurt you, I just check to verify something..

<p> Verify WH-

<p> (The man grabs my hand and look at the birthmark I had between my fingers)
<br>
<p> Man: I knew it. Listen-
<br>
<p> Why are you grabbing me, let GO of me. (Snatched my hand away)
<br>
<p> Man: I'm sorry I didn't mean to startle you. I need you to understand I wasn't going to harm you no. I needed to check if it was really you Iris.</p>
