<h1>This is a lot to take in..</h1>
<p>I… I don’t understand. How could I not remember any of this? My family... my life? How do know you're not lying to me? How can I trust you like wha-
<br>
<p>The man’s face softens with sympathy, but there’s a deep sadness behind his eyes.
<br>
<p>Man: I know this is overwhelming, and I’m sorry. But your memories were erased, hidden from you, just like your name. She kept you away from everything. Changed your life, your identity. Made sure you wouldn’t remember who you were... or who she was.</p>
<br>
<p> Hold on..would you know I was here? How can you magically find me today out of all days
<br>
<p> Man: I’ve been a ranger for most of my life, and I’ve dedicated a lot of time to scouting this area in particular. Your old neighbors told me you used to love playing out here when you were little. So I’ve been coming back, looking for a sign, anything that would lead me to you.
<br>
<p> (The man lowers his gaze for a moment, as if gathering his thoughts.)
<br>
<p> Man: It wasn’t just by chance. I’ve been searching for you for years, trying to follow the trail, even if it’s faint. I knew this area meant something to you when you were younger, and I hoped it might still be a place where you’d find comfort, or where you'd return, even if you didn’t remember why.
<br>
<p> Man: This wasn’t just about finding you today. It’s been a long search—one that started way before today.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p> (Police sirens coming closer)
<br>
<p> The police?
<br>
<p> Man: Ha, my "buddies".. come, let's get you comfortable for questioning.
