<p>(Man uses his phone.. take a while though. Like a good 5 minutes. Then quickly hangs up</p>
<br>
<p> (Man comes towards me when no phone) Listen, my phone was dying but I called my buddies here so you can use their phone. Is that alright? 
<br>
<p> *Thinking* *What? He was just using his phone. He could’ve handed it to me first, and I’d only need it for a couple of minutes. This is strange. And he had enough time to call his friends over here so I could use their phones? Something doesn’t add up…*<br>
<br>
<p> Uh yea..I guess. 
<br>
<p> Man: Sorry about that, I had to make an important call about something to my buddies first.
