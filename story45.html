<p>You used the dagger to stab the man in the neck for self-defense. The man tried to add pressure to the stab wound. He collapsed instantly and died</p>

<p> ...Wait no I didn't mean- I'm so-

<br> SIRENS
<p> What the cops?? How did they-
<br>
<p> I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to escape or that would seem suspicous.
<p>I stood above the dead man's body until the police were practically banging the door. They saw the body and instantly arrested me. I tried to explain it was for self-defense but still arrested her otherwise.
<br>
<p> GET ON THE GROUND. AND PUT YOUR HANDS UP

<p> NO.. HE WAS COMING AFTER ME I WAS JUST-
<br>
<p> DO AS YOUR TOLD NOW 
<br>
<p> I get on the ground. I'm handcuffed and taken into custody. I get sentenced to life

<p> Well..you did that. 
<p>  Why you gotta stab the man though. 
<p> Route Choosen: Meh. You were making good decisons. Until you didn't. 
<p> Score: 40/100 
<p>Backstory: 80% complete (wow look at that you were almost done too)
<p> But hey.. let's <a href="story20.html"> try again</a>. Hopefully you're not dumb enough to make bad choices again.
